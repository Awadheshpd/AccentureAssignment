Difference between this and let.

Let:
------

In javascript, we use "let" to define a variable. "let" is a block level variable. 
It is available only in the block in which it is defined.

for example: 

function sum() {
    let x=0;
    if(true) {
        let y=0;
    }
}

So, in this example, the variable y will be accessible in the "if" block only. We cannot
access it outside this block.



This:
------

"this" is a keyword. It is used to access variables;
So, if a variable is defined like 
    var a = 5;
    then we can access it by using
    "this.a = 9"


So, let is used to declare variable whereas "this" is used to access that variable.
